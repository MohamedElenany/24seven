1,"Forward Sortation Area (FSA©)
The counts for Forward Sortation Area (FSA©) codes are based on the first three characters of the postal codesOM collected from 2021 Census questionnaires. The first character of a postal codeOM corresponds to a province, a territory, or a region within a province (Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021 Table 1.9).
The postal codeOM is captured for all households from the address information provided or confirmed by the respondent on the 2021 Census questionnaire. The same postal codeOM was assigned to all members of a given household to enable the compilation of various census data.
The reported postal codesOM are then processed and validated according to specific criteria. Postal codesOM were determined to be applicable for the 2021 Census if they appeared as active records as per Canada Post Corporation (CPC) in May 2021, the month of the Census. However, postal codesOM provided by the respondents were considered acceptable if they were found in the file from CPC within the six months leading up to the Census. This is consistent with the effort to represent the postal codesOM whenever they could be considered as being active and in use at the time of the Census. In cases where a postal codeOM was not provided or was invalid, an imputation process assigned a valid postal codeOM. At the end of this process, a postal code is associated with each census household.
The postal codeOM provided by respondents may not be the same as the postal codeOM of their dwelling. For example, they may denote the postal codeOM of their mailing address, such as a post office location (as in the case of general delivery) or a business location. Consequently, some respondents' postal codesOM may fall outside the FSA© in which their dwelling is located.
While these processes allow census respondents to provide postal codesOM of any category (for instance, a commercial postal codeOM or a large volume receiver postal codeOM), analysis of census results has shown that this occurs only for a small number of households. If an FSA© is not represented by postal codesOM reported on census questionnaires, it is not included in census products or the Census Forward Sortation Area©Boundary File, 2021 Census. Where a postal codeOM is not frequently reported in a dissemination area, it may not be represented in the 2021 Census Forward Sortation Area© Boundary File which is built from dissemination areas. As a result, whereas 1,646 FSAs© were reported in the 2021 Census, only 1,643 are represented in the boundary file.
All households that provided a postal codeOM with the same FSA© were grouped to calculate FSA© totals in census products. Users should proceed with caution if FSAs© or postal codesOM are used as a proxy for standard geographic areas. Forward Sortation Areas© and postal codesOM do not necessarily respect the boundaries of standard geographic areas (Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2021).
