# 24Seven Location Expansion Optimization Dashboard

## Main Objective

The overarching goal of the 24Seven Expansion Dashboard Project is to empower the leadership team at 24Seven, a thriving 24-hour convenience store chain, with actionable insights for strategic decision-making regarding the opening of their 11th store in Canada. The project is driven by a commitment to harnessing the power of data to ensure the new store is strategically located to not only meet customer needs but also maximize accessibility and reliability. Leveraging open-source datasets, the project employs advanced analytics and predictive modeling to deliver a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that not only analyzes historic sales data but also forecasts future demand. The primary objective is to facilitate the identification of optimal store locations, thereby supporting 24Seven's expansion plan with a data-driven and customer-centric approach.

### Use Case 1: Location Optimization
The Optimal Location Dashboard serves as a sophisticated tool for guiding the selection of strategic locations for the 11th store. It amalgamates multiple data points, including existing store distribution, provincial economic and educational indicators, and population density versus competition. Through key performance indicators (KPIs) and relationship mapping, this dashboard aids in the identification of potential cities that align with 24Seven's growth objectives. It empowers decision-makers to navigate the complexities of market dynamics, ensuring that the chosen locations not only have a strong customer base but also align with economic and educational criteria.

### Use Case 2: Sales Trend Analysis
The Sales Trend Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of 24Seven's historical sales performance. By delving into monthly sales trends across different years, customer engagement by product category, demographic sales analysis, and regional sales distribution, this dashboard equips the leadership team with critical insights. It enables stakeholders to understand the dynamics of customer preferences, identify top-performing product categories, and recognize regional variations in sales. This knowledge is instrumental for inventory planning, targeted marketing, and formulating informed business strategies.

### Use Case 3: Sales Forecasting and Scenario Analysis
The Sales Forecasting and Scenario Analysis Dashboard integrates advanced predictive analytics using gradient boosting to forecast sales volume for the new store in 2024. Leveraging a predictive model developed through Python scripting, the dashboard allows stakeholders to interactively model various 'what-if' scenarios. Users can adjust discount rates and demand changes to visualize the impact on forecasted sales. The dashboard aids in understanding the sensitivity of sales forecasts to changes in key variables and provides a valuable tool for decision-makers to explore different scenarios, ensuring robust planning and adaptability to dynamic market conditions.

## Results

The project has produced significant outcomes, enhancing 24Seven's analytical capabilities and decision-making processes. These include the successful integration and cleaning of external datasets, covering diverse demographics and economic indicators. The establishment of relationship mappings ensures data consistency and integrity throughout the analysis. The development of three interactive dashboards, each addressing a distinct use case, provides nuanced insights for strategic expansion decisions. Implementation of dynamic filters, key metrics, and visualizations enhances the user experience, facilitating intuitive exploration of the data. Additionally, the creation of DAX queries supports the calculation of key performance indicators, contributing to comprehensive data analysis.
